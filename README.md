# Deep Learning Fundus Image Analysis For Early Detection Of Diabetic Retinopathy


Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a common complication of diabetes mellitus, which causes lesions on the retina that affect vision.If it is not detected early, it can lead to blindness. Unfortunately, DR is not a reversible process, and treatment only sustains vision. DR early detection and treatment can significantly reduce the risk of vision loss. The manual diagnosis process of DR retina fundus images by ophthalmologists is time, effort and cost-consuming and prone to misdiagnosis unlike computer-aided diagnosis systems. 


# Project Objectives
  Know fundamental concepts and techniques of transfer learning like Xception.

  Gain a broad understanding of image data.

  Know how to pre-process/clean the data using different data pre-processing techniques.

  Know how to build a web application using the Flask framework.
  
# Project Flow

The user interacts with the UI (User Interface) to choose the image.

The chosen image analyzed by the model which is integrated with flask application.

The Xception Model analyzes the image, then the prediction is showcased on the Flask UI.

## To accomplish this, we have to complete all the activities and tasks listed below

Data Collection.

    Create a Train and Test path.

Data Pre-processing.

    Import the required library

    Configure ImageDataGenerator class

    Apply ImageDataGenerator functionality to Trainset and Testset
