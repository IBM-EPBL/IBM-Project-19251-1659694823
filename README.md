# Deep Learning Fundus Image Analysis For Early Detection Of Diabetic Retinopathy


Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a common complication of diabetes mellitus, which causes lesions on the retina that affect vision.If it is not detected early, it can lead to blindness. Unfortunately, DR is not a reversible process, and treatment only sustains vision. DR early detection and treatment can significantly reduce the risk of vision loss. The manual diagnosis process of DR retina fundus images by ophthalmologists is time, effort and cost-consuming and prone to misdiagnosis unlike computer-aided diagnosis systems. 



# Project Flow

* The user interacts with the UI (User Interface) to choose the image.

* The chosen image analyzed by the model which is integrated with flask application.

* The Xception Model analyzes the image, then the prediction is showcased on the Flask UI.
